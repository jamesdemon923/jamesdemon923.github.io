## Introduction

### Example of Sub-Heading 1

## Hair & Fur rendering

### Representation

#### Card & Mesh

#### Strand

### Shading Model

#### Kajiya-Kay Model

$$
Color = Diffuse + Specular
$$



#### Marschner Model

Marschner model is a physically-based model. It seeks to simulate the way light interacts with hair in a realistic way by taking into account the complex scattering properties of individual hair strands.
$$
S = S_{R} + S_{TT} + S_{TRT}
$$



#### Dual Scattering Model

#### Physically-based double cylinder fur reflectance Model
