## What is ImGui

ImGui stands for "Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface". It is a programming paradigm used in user interface development where UI elements are updated and rendered each frame. In contrast to retained mode GUI, IMGUI does not keep a persistent model of the UI state.

Every frame, the entire user interface is recreated using a series of function calls, each of which may cause immediate rendering of UI elements on the screen. User interactions, like button clicks or slider changes, are processed in the same function that draws the UI element, typically by returning a value indicating the interaction.

One of the most prominent libraries implementing the IMGUI approach is [**Dear ImGui**](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). It is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++ primarily used for tools and game development.
