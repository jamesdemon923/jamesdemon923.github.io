## What is ImGui

ImGui stands for "Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface". It is a programming paradigm used in user interface development where UI elements are updated and rendered each frame. In contrast to retained mode GUI, IMGUI does not keep a persistent model of the UI state.

Every frame, the entire user interface is recreated using a series of function calls, each of which may cause immediate rendering of UI elements on the screen. User interactions, like button clicks or slider changes, are processed in the same function that draws the UI element, typically by returning a value indicating the interaction.

One of the most prominent libraries implementing the IMGUI approach is [**Dear ImGui**](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). It is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++ primarily used for tools and game development.

## How to use it

Integrating ImGui into our project will require some setup. We will need to initialize ImGui, set up the platform and renderer bindings, and integrate ImGui's rendering into our main render loop. In the case of OpenGL, we would typically use the imgui_impl_glfw.cpp and imgui_impl_opengl3.cpp (or imgui_impl_opengl2.cpp, depending on the version of OpenGL we are using) files to set up the necessary bindings.
