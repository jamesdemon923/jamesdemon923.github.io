<p>Hi! I’m Haolan Xu(许皓岚), currently a Master student in University of Florida, working with <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jorg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Jorg Peters</a>. I received my Bachelor’s degree at Sichuan University, working with <a href="https://ce.scu.edu.cn/info/1092/4061.htm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof.Li Zhou</a>.</p>

<p>My research mainly focuses on rendering and 3D reconstruction, more specifically, real-time ray tracing, geometry processing, multiple view synthesis.</p>
