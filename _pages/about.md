Hi! I'm **Haolan Xu (许皓岚)**, currently a Master student in University of Florida, working with [Prof. Jorg Peters](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jorg/). I received my Bachelor's degree at Sichuan University, working with [Prof. Li Zhou](https://ce.scu.edu.cn/info/1092/4061.htm).

My aim is to generate high-quality assets with enough physical accuracy for the immersive virtual environment, help machines understand the world, and make advanced 3D graphics and vision accessible to non-specialists. I have been exploring the following research directions:

- Differentiable Rendering
- Neural Rendering & Scene Representations
- Generative models

Outside of work, I love traveling, NBA, and video games.

**I'm happy to chat about research or anything else and eager for more collaborations on these topics. Feel free to reach out!**



#### ✨I am currently looking for related research collaboration!✨
