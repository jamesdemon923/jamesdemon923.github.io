Hi! I'm **Haolan Xu (许皓岚)**, currently a Master student in University of Florida, working with [Prof. Jorg Peters](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jorg/). I received my Bachelor's degree at Sichuan University, working with [Prof. Li Zhou](https://ce.scu.edu.cn/info/1092/4061.htm).

My aim is to create realistic virtual assets with enough physical accuracy for immersive experiences, making advanced graphics and vision accessible to all. I have been exploring the following research directions:

- Inverse rendering (Differentiable Rendering, Neural Implicits)
- Generative models (GANs, Diffusion Models)
- Importance sampling (ReSTIR)
- Appearance modeling (SVBRDF, BSDF)

Besides the research, I’m a video game player, a NBA big fan, and a traveler.

**I'm happy to chat about research or anything else and eager for more collaborations on these topics. Feel free to reach out!**
