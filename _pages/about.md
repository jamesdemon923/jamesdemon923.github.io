Hi! I'm Haolan Xu(许皓岚), currently a Master student in University of Florida, supervised by [Prof. Jorg Peters](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jorg/). 

My research mainly focuses on modeling and rendering. 

Besides the research, I’m a big fan of video games([Red Dead Redemption](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/), [Call of Duty](https://www.callofduty.com/)), as well as a devoted basketball fan.
