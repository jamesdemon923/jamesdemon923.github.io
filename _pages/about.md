Hi! I'm Haolan Xu(许皓岚), currently a Master student in University of Florida, working with [Prof. Jorg Peters](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jorg/). I received my Bachelor's degree at Sichuan University, working with [Prof.Li Zhou](https://ce.scu.edu.cn/info/1092/4061.htm).

My research mainly focuses on rendering and modeling, more specifically, real-time ray tracing, subdivision.

Besides the research, I’m a big fan of video games([Red Dead Redemption](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/), [Call of Duty](https://www.callofduty.com/)), as well as a basketball fan.
