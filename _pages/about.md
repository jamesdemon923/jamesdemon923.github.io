Hi! I'm Haolan Xu(许皓岚), currently a Master student in University of Florida, working with [Prof. Jorg Peters](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jorg/). I received my Bachelor's degree at Sichuan University, working with [Prof.Li Zhou](https://ce.scu.edu.cn/info/1092/4061.htm).

My research mainly focuses on rendering and 3D reconstruction, more specifically, real-time ray tracing, geometry processing, multiple view synthesis.

Besides the research, I’m a video games player, a traveller, and a NBA big fan.

Test!
