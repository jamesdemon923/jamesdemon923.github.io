Hi! I'm **Haolan Xu(许皓岚)**, currently a Master student in University of Florida, working with [Prof. Jorg Peters](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jorg/). I received my Bachelor's degree at Sichuan University, working with [Prof.Li Zhou](https://ce.scu.edu.cn/info/1092/4061.htm).

I have been exploring the following research directions:

- **Inverse rendering (Differentiable Rendering, Neural Scene Representations and Rendering)**
- **Generative models (GANs, Diffusion models)**
- Importance sampling (RIS, ReSTIR)
- Appearance modeling (Subsurface scattering)

**Welcome to delve into these topics with me. Sharing ideas is something I truly value. I look forward to a deeper collaboration with you. Feel free to contact me!**

Besides the research, I’m a video games player, a traveller, and a NBA big fan.
