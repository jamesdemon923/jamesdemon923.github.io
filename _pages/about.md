Hi! I'm **Haolan Xu (许皓岚)**, currently a visiting student in [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://ece.illinois.edu/), working with [Narendra Ahuja](https://vision.ai.illinois.edu/). Before that, I got my MSCS in [University of Florida](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/), working with [Prof. Jorg Peters](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jorg/), and my Bachelor's degree in Sichuan University.

My aim is to help machines understand the world and generate scene-aware 3D/4D assets with enough physical accuracy while making advanced 3D graphics and vision techniques accessible to non-specialists. I have been exploring the following research directions:

- Neural Rendering & Scene Representations
- 3D/4D Generative Models

Outside of work, I love traveling, NBA, and video games.

**I'm happy to chat about research or anything else and eager for more collaborations on these topics. Feel free to reach out!**



##### ✨I am looking for research collaboration!!!✨
